## Description

I've got this ROBOTIC ARM at Amazon 1 or 2 years ago and it cost under 30 dollars.Â â€‹At the beginning it was funny ... a robotic arm controlled by a console with a lot of pieces, each one controlling one of the 5 servo motors. Below is an example how was the original console:

After long 10 minutes, I started thinking how to improve this robotic-arm, how to improve its movements, how to make it more realistic.

As an Arduino enthusiastic, why not use one of the arduinos I had to control this arm, using a different input sensor ? 

The next step was to use a Gyroscope and make the movements of a human arm to control this Robot arm. Movements UP and DOWN, Right or Left could be send to Arduino and translated into signals to servo motors.

Using aÂ [Wii Nunchuck](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Nunchuk-Controller-White-Wii-U/dp/B0094X2066), and its internal Gyroscope (or the joystick, if you prefer), we could control these servo motors and make this toy much more fun.

And that is the project 04: disconnect the original controlls and insert a new, more realistic and much more easy to use control, using a gyroscope to do that ! :)

Next steps ?! ... maybe adapt a gyroscope in a glove and use your hand/arm to control this robotic-arm.
