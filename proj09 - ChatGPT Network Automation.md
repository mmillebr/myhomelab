We all know #ChatGPT is an AI developed by #OpenAI, built on a large language model (LLM). Itâ€™s great at handling and generating text in a way that feels like natural conversation. Some of the most useful things you can do with ChatGPT include:
- chatbot
- writing articles, essays, music
- writing emails, social media posts
- coding
- summarize texts
- translation

In summary, any text-related task is a breeze for it.

On the other hand, network devices configuration files are basically text files too. You can easily ask your genAI tool to give you the config file for a specific device, as long as you give a clear description of what you need. It's just a matter to generate text in a particular "language".

Bringing both ideas together, this project will use chatGPT not to create your config files, but to check how correct the config on your devices are compared to a template/baseline config. It'll read the current config from your network device (text file), add the template or baseline config (another text file), and send them via API call to OpenAI. You can ask it to compare, give you the inputs, comments and also to provide some insights about best practices or other information related to your device.

Because it's a Python script, you can easily adapt it to ready 10s or 100s of devices and check configuration compliance for your entire infrastructure.

## Netmiko to talk to your Switch

The switch I'll be using is an Aruba 2930F-8p that I have in my HomeLAB. Here is the basic Python script to SSH to this device, read the "running config" information and print it in your screen. Just a basic config, no concerns about security, best practices, etc...

```python
from netmiko import ConnectHandler  
    
# Function to connect to Aruba switch and retrieve running config  
def get_aruba_config(host, username, password):  
    device = {  
        'device_type': 'hp_procurve',  # Aruba switch device type  
        'host': host,  
        'username': username,  
        'password': password,  
    }  
  
    # Connect to the switch  
    try:  
        connection = ConnectHandler(**device)    
        # Get the running configuration  
        running_config = connection.send_command('show running-config')    
        # Close the connection  
        connection.disconnect()  
        # Return the running configuration  
        return running_config  
  
    except Exception as e:  
        print(f"Error connecting to the switch: {e}")  
        return None    
  
# Main function  
def main():  
    # Define Aruba switch credentials  
    host = '192.168.2.98'  # Replace with the IP of your Aruba switch  
    username = 'admin'  # Replace with your switch username  
    password = 'admin'  # Replace with your switch password  
  
    # Retrieve the running config 
    running_config = get_aruba_config(host, username, password)  
  
    # Print the result on screen  
    if running_config:  
        print("Running Configuration:")  
        print(running_config)  
    else:  
        print("Failed to retrieve the configuration.")    
  
if __name__ == "__main__":  
    main()
```

## OpenAI API Integration - "Hello World"

To use chatGPT via API calls, you'll need a paid account. In my case, I just created an account and bought some credits that will be enough for this project and another one to integrate with my HomeAssistant. You'll need to generate an API_key to be used in your code.

Here is an example to create your 1st integration with ChatGPT using API, kind of "hello world.py" using the OpenAI library:

```python
import os  
from openai import OpenAI  
  
client = OpenAI(  
    # This is the default and can be omitted  
    # openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")    
    api_key="PUT YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY HERE...",  
)  
  
chat_completion = client.chat.completions.create(  
    messages=[  
        {  
            "role": "user",  
            "content": "Tell me something about network automation, just a few words",  
        }  
    ],  
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  
)  
  
print(chat_completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

Result:

```
C:\Users\USER\PycharmProjects\ArubaAutomation\.venv> python3 .\test_openai.py
Network automation involves using software and tools to automate the management, provisioning, and configuration of network devices.
```


## Network Config Compliance

Now it's time to create the final script. It'll be responsible for:
- SSH to the switch and read the current configuration
- Define the Template, as well as the prompt to be sent to ChatGPT with the instructions
- OpenAI API call with all the TEXT information and instructions 
- print the final result - **Compliance Report**

```python
import os  
from openai import OpenAI  
from netmiko import ConnectHandler  
  
# OpenAI API key setup  
client = OpenAI(  
    # This is the default and can be omitted  
    # openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")    
    api_key="PUT YOUR OPENAI_API_KEY HERE...",  
)  
    
# Function to connect to Aruba switch and retrieve running config  
def get_aruba_config(host, username, password):  
    device = {  
        'device_type': 'hp_procurve',  # Aruba switch device type  
        'host': host,  
        'username': username,  
        'password': password,  
    }   
    # Connect to the switch  
    try:  
        connection = ConnectHandler(**device)    
        # Get the running configuration  
        running_config = connection.send_command('show running-config')    
        # Close the connection  
        connection.disconnect()    
        # Return the running configuration  
        return running_config  
  
    except Exception as e:  
        print(f"Error connecting to the switch: {e}")  
        return None  
  
  
# Function to send template and config to OpenAI for compliance analysis  
def check_config_compliance(template, current_config):  
    prompt = f"""

Final comments:
- of course all coding here was generated using ChatGPT help 
- i've tried chatGPT 3.5, but the responses were not good enough
- v4, although more expensive, gives me a much better result 
- this is a test in my personal LAB. Still lot a things to be improved.

For reference, here is the switch config:

and here the Compliance Report generated by ChatGPT via Python API-call:

```
C:\...\.venv> python3 .\compliance.py  
Compliance Report:
Alright, comparing the template to the current configuration, here are the differences, errors, or missing parts:

1. Under the hostname, the names differ, but since it's tagged as <any>, both are valid.
   
2. The template doesn't include a "mirror" command but it's present in the current configuration.

3. There's a slight alteration in the `logging 192.168.2.222 control-descr` line. The template allows <any>, so it's not technically an error, but worth noting.

4. `ip default-gateway` matches the template. However, under `ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0`, the current configuration deviates a tad. While both IPs are valid, they're different from the placeholder IPs, but this is to be expected.

5. An additional command, `interface 3 with monitor all both mirror 1`, is seen in the current configuration, which is not present in the template.

6. On the vlan 1, untagged 1-10 and ip address `192.168.2.98 255.255.255.0` are spot on with the template parameters.

7. The vlan 98's name "vlan_teste" differs from the template's "vlan-test", which is an error and mismatch.

8. Vlan 1234, named "compliance_vlan," is missing from the current configuration

As for the best practices:

- Remain consistent with naming conventions to avoid confusion. Hence, try to maintain same names in all switches like "vlan-test", instead of different ones like "vlan_teste".
- Keep the configuration as minimal as needed for the operation for security and maintainability. If the "mirror" and "interface 3" commands are not necessary, consider removing them.
- And lastly, remember to include all necessary vlans, because senior network guys like me do not love troubleshooting only to find out that a missing vlan is the problem. For your case, you might wanna add vlan 1234.

That's it for now. If you need anything else, I'm here to help!
