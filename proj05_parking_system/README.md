# Arduino Public Parking System
🚗🚦🅿️

#arduino #ultrassonic 


## Description 

Have you ever seen those systems with green and red LEDs in big parking lots, like supermarkets or big malls ? The idea for this project is to simulate those systems using a cheap solution: Arduino as the controller and ultrassonic sensors to check if each parking space is free or not.

If you pay attention in a real system, it uses almost the same ultrassonic sensor to check if there is a car in the parking space or not. It measures the distance from the sensor to the ground ... that´s it !

The same idea was used here in this project. I also used a display to show the capacity of teh parking (only 2 in this super project), and real time information about how many free slots are still available. All these information are controlled by an Arduino UNO !

Have fun !!
